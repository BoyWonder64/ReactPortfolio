            This Repo contains all of the react code for this site that I built.
            This was made for an assignment. The only requirements were to have
            the basic pages setup to allow for the user to navigate between
            pages. I performed the logic to allow for the form to actually work.

            Written using the MERN Stack. The purpose of this project was to
            demonstrate my knowledge and abilities to use react. The largest
            being figuring out how the diagonals. I resolved this by using a
            hard-coded array and then simply checking if each option was in the
            array.

           Written with Javascript and React. I used a hook to help give user feedback. The 
           main requirement for this was to recieve data from a user form and then display it.
           The database is a firebase database. The data is saved in a json format and is very
           simple to work with. Overall I really liked this project and was very content with
           my results.
